                    This majestic animal is a great companion. The animal has the ability to defend you, which I believe is it's best characteristic. In addition to this, this animal is also very loving and playful. 
        
                    German Shepherds are used in K-9 Units for special task forces in the police department. They are also good guard dogs and will defend any property it calls home. There are many other uses of this animal, but all in all, they are mans best friend.
